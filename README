XML::RDDL - Interface to RDDL (http://www.rddl.org/)


RDDL (Resource Directory Description Language) is an XML vocabulary
used to described resources associated with a namespace. It can be
embedded inside other XML vocabularies (most frequently XHTML).

This module is meant to be used as a SAX2 handler that will return a
Directory instance containing all resource descriptions at the end of
the parse. It also features a SAX2 Driver to generate XML from an RDDL
object.
